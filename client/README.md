# **Getting Started with Create React App**

This project is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a modern toolchain for building React applications. Below, you’ll find a comprehensive guide to the available scripts and best practices for managing your application.

---

## **Available Scripts**

Within the project directory, the following scripts are available for use:  

### **`npm start`**
- **Purpose**: Runs the application in development mode.  
- **Access**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred web browser.  
- **Features**:  
  - Automatic live reloading upon code changes.  
  - Real-time linting messages displayed in the browser console.  

---

### **`npm test`**
- **Purpose**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for iterative testing during development.  
- **Reference**: For a detailed guide, visit the [Running Tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).  

---

### **`npm run build`**
- **Purpose**: Creates an optimized production build in the `build` directory.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Bundles and minifies the code for optimal performance.  
  - Generates unique file names with hashes for cache management.  
- **Outcome**: Produces a deployable version of your application.  
- **Reference**: For deployment guidelines, refer to the [Deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).  

---

### **`npm run eject`**
> **Note**: This action is irreversible. Proceed with caution.  

- **Purpose**: Provides complete control over the project’s configuration by extracting all settings and dependencies into the project directory.  
- **Scenarios**: Use this only if you need advanced customizations to the default setup.  
- **Impact**:  
  - Enables manual modification of tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.  
  - Post-ejection, other scripts (`start`, `test`, `build`) will rely on the customized configuration.

## **Advanced Topics**

### **Code Splitting**  
Improve performance by dynamically loading parts of your application. Learn more in the [Code Splitting guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting).  

### **Analyzing Bundle Size**  
Optimize your app by understanding and reducing bundle size. Details are available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).  

### **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**  
Convert your application into a Progressive Web App for offline capabilities and better user experiences. Read the guide [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app).  

### **Advanced Configuration**  
Customize the default configurations of Create React App. Visit the [Advanced Configuration guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).  

### **Deployment**  
Learn how to deploy your React app to various platforms. Check the [Deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).  

### **Troubleshooting**  
If `npm run build` fails to minify, refer to the troubleshooting guide [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).
